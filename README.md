# 🕣 React Time Conversion
This project aims to help me understand some of the basic components of [React](https://react.dev/) while also possibly helping others convert their time as needed. This repository details the code necessary to make a base website that is being displayed.

## 🟢 Quick Breakdown
- Made using [React](https://react.dev/) for learning ⚛️
- Website that converts the time as the value is inserted ⏳
- Clock drawing is self made 🎨

## 🧭 Navigation
- Insert the number that needs to be converted into the input field ⬜
- Select the time type that is being converted ⏲️
- Watch the numbers change on the webpage as you type 💻

## ❤️ Thank You
- Thank you for checking out the website I made for learning purposes! It's not perfect, but I plan to update it as I learn more overtime. 😃
