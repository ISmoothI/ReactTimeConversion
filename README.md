# ✏️ Yet Another Calculator Website (YACW)
This project aims to help me understand some of the basic components of [React](https://react.dev/) while also possibly helping others convert their time as needed. This repository details the code necessary to make a base website that is being displayed.

## 🟢 Quick Breakdown
- Made using [React](https://react.dev/) for learning ⚛️
- Website that allows for calculation and conversion at the same time, in the same window 🪟
- Code is made from scratch to get a better understanding of how things should work in JavaScript
- Drawings are self made 🎨
